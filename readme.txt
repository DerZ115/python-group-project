    Answers to questions
1) A study of conserved genes using the eggNOG database
    1. Which genes are universally required for an organism to survive
        1. How many per domain?
            Archaea: 175
            Bacteria: 123
            Eukaryota: 273
        2. Provide the results as three files listing the OGs in sorted order (by name)
            cogs_archaea_o99.txt
            cogs_bacteria_o99.txt
            cogs_eukaryota_o99.txt

    2. Which common bacterial genes occur almost exclusively as single-copy genes?
        1. Provide the results as a sorted text file.
            cogs_bacteria_o50_u99.txt
        2. How many of these OGs were also identified as universal bacterial OGs?
            73

    3. Identify all OGs that occur as single-copy in at least 97 % of all archaea?
        1. How many such OGs did you identify? Provide the results as a sorted text file.
            121
            cogs_archaea_os97.txt
        2. Are there archaea which lack 4 or more of these universal OGs? Which organism lacks the most?
            Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3                   missing 7 OGs
            Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum OPF8     missing 6 OGs
            Candidatus Nitrosopumilus sediminis         missing 5 OGs
            Thermosphaera aggregans DSM 11486           missing 4 OGs
            Halobiforma nitratireducens JCM 10879       missing 4 OGs
            Halobellus rufus                            missing 4 OGs
